# Neobarb TeX Filter
A custom [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) filter to automate conversion of the
first volume of Neobarbarian lore (initially codified in
LaTeX markup). Mainly smoothes out certain parts of the
AST representation.

Useless to the average acolyte without access to the original
tome. If the scripture were to fall into the wrong hands, though...
