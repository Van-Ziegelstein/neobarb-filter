# Neobarb Filter
A custom [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) filter to automate conversion of the
sacred tomes of the Neobarbarian tribe. Smoothes out certain parts of the
AST representation when converting the source files (mainly in LaTeX and HTML format)
into epub books.

Useless to the average acolyte without access to the original
scriptures. If those were to fall into the wrong hands, though...
