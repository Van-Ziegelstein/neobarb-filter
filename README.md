# Neobarb TeX Filter
A custom [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) filter to automate conversion of the
sacred tomes of the Neobarbarian tribe (initially codified in
LaTeX markup). Mainly smoothes out certain parts of the
AST representation.

Useless to the average acolyte without access to the original
scriptures. If those were to fall into the wrong hands, though...
